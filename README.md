# Sign Language Translation Glove Using Arduino Nano

## Overview
This project showcases a wearable glove capable of translating sign language gestures into readable text and transmitting it wirelessly to a mobile device. It utilizes **Arduino Nano**, **flex sensors**, an **MPU6050 gyroscope/accelerometer**, and an **HC-05 Bluetooth module**, providing a low-cost solution to bridge the communication gap for individuals relying on sign language.

## Features
- Detects and recognizes hand gestures using **flex sensors** and **MPU6050 motion data**.
- Translates gestures into text.
- Sends real-time translations to a connected mobile device via **Bluetooth**.

---

## Components
- **Arduino Nano**: Microcontroller for data processing.
- **Flex Sensors (x3)**: Measure finger bending.
- **MPU6050 Gyroscope/Accelerometer**: Detects hand motion and orientation.
- **HC-05 Bluetooth Module**: Enables wireless communication.
- **Miscellaneous Components**: Glove, wires, resistors.

## System Design
### 1. Hardware
- **Flex Sensors**: Capture finger bending values.
- **MPU6050**: Measures motion data (acceleration and gyroscope).
- **Bluetooth Communication**: Sends recognized gestures to a mobile device.

### 2. Software
The Arduino code implements:
- **Sensor Calibration**: Ensures consistent gesture recognition by storing calibration values in EEPROM.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Combines flex sensor and motion data to classify gestures.
- **Bluetooth Integration**: Sends detected gestures as text.

---

## How It Works
1. The system initializes and checks for calibration values stored in EEPROM.
2. Sensors capture data:
   - Flex sensor values are mapped and constrained between 0â€“1000.
   - Accelerometer and gyroscope data refine gesture recognition.
3. The code processes this data to identify gestures based on predefined conditions.
4. Recognized gestures are sent via Bluetooth to a mobile device.
